Contribution:I have tried a lot of things .I got the the knowledge of Heap.I have have practicesed and made a model and took two names and I made heap after I heapified it drawn a graph and i made array and using that i started coding.

Instruction:instruction to run the program.we used eclipse or
notepad commandprompt or any other Java IDE.create class
name :"Asn03G50P03.java" save and run the program

Challenges faced:I had an idea about the heap by your teaching .But coding was little difficult and i took time to under the problem and solved the problem and made array pattern and using the algorithm and  rules of the binary tree.Max heap and Min was little confusing.I found the difference and solved.
